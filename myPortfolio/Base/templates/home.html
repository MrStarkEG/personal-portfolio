                    <h3>My first project as a learner ü•∞ !</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>2 months after learning my first programming language, I started learning new libraries in Pythonüêç.
                        I created my first script with python to parse some data from a certain site (Can't mention it HUH üòÅ)
                        which was really fun to do (still üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I carried on doing the same thing on different websites to be more advanced in the web scraping field,
                        and I can say I really enjoyed scraping then.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I decided then that I needed to make the data more readable for the human-eye,
                        so I learned JSON and Pandas in Python to make my data more readable. It was my first project and I really can't describe how interesting it was üôå.
                    </p>

					<hr>
					<p>Read & Build Ugly Prototypes First.</p>

					<p>I can learn just about anything by having a final product to tear apart piece by piece. 
                        I break the code where I need to figure out why things work the way they do. 
                        Documentation is just a reference.</p></div>

				<hr>
				<p>After almost 4 years of working with the same stuff I‚Äôm ready to learn something new. 
                    I'll be collaborating and sharing my experience with others on my youtube channel.</p>
				<p>Aside from building small projects I would love to enter a position where I can be part of a bigger team 
                    & learn from others with more experience than myself.</p>
